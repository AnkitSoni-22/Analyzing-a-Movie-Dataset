**Purpose**
The purpose of this document is to provide a detailed Software Requirements
Specification (SRS) for the Movie Dataset Analysis project. This project aims to analyze
a movie dataset to gain insights into various aspects such as popular genres, highest grossing movies, and the relationship between budget and revenue.


**Scope**
The scope of this project includes the following tasks:

Data collection and preparation

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Data visualization

Summarization of findings


**Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations**

SRS: Software Requirements Specification

EDA: Exploratory Data Analysis

TMDb: The Movie Database

CSV: Comma-Separated Values


**References**

TMDb Movie Dataset on Kaggle

Python Data Analysis Library: Pandas Documentation

Data Visualization Library: Matplotlib Documentation and Seaborn Documentation


**The project will perform the following functions:**

Load and explore the movie dataset

Clean and preprocess the dataset

Analyze and visualize data to uncover insights

Present findings and insights in a structured format


**Data Collection**

FR1: Download the TMDb movie dataset from Kaggle.

FR2: Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame for analysis.


**Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**

FR3: Identify and handle missing values appropriately.

FR4: Remove any duplicate entries in the dataset.

FR5: Convert data types as necessary (e.g., date strings to datetime objects).


**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

FR6: Analyze the distribution of movie genres.

FR7: Identify the top 10 highest-grossing movies.

FR8: Examine the relationship between movie budget and revenue.

FR9: Analyze the trend of movie production over the years.


**Data Visualization**

FR10: Create bar charts for genre distribution.

FR11: Generate scatter plots for budget vs. revenue analysis.

FR12: Plot line graphs for movie production trends over time.


**Appendix A: Glossary**

DataFrame: A two-dimensional, size-mutable, potentially heterogeneous tabular
data structure with labeled axes (rows and columns).

Correlation: A statistical measure that describes the extent to which two variables
change together.

Visualization: The graphical representation of data to facilitate understanding
